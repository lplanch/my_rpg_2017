No ! Zach is dead !
He was so young...
We all told him not to go by night
But he did it to find the artifact..
But he got trapped !
Why would someone kill an adventurer !
--j
Look over there, the killer left a letter !
----------OPEN---------LETTER---------------
For the Glory of Hell and Heaven,
A human sacrifice has been done.
...
~ Champ, Hell Baron.
----------CLOSE---------LETTER--------------
--s
Who can be that Champ ?
Does hell really exists ?
--j
The abyss still claims a lot of mystery
We need to go deeper to understand !
--s
It's too dangerous !
No one ever came back from deeper !
Let's get back to the orphanage.
We need to tell to everyone.
--------RETOUR INSTANT ORPHELINAT- DODO----
